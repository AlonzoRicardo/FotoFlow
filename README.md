# 2nd IronHack Project
Inspired by the youtube videos where people take 1 picture every day for a year and then put all the images together to form a fast pace video.

Using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, HandleBars and Ffmpeg.

Create an account head to the camara section, take pictures and store them in a base64 encoding in your database, every time the user saves the images, Ffmpeg unites all of the pictures ever taken by that user to form a video that is displayed in the front page.
